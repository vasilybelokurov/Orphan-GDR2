\section{Introduction}

Long and narrow streams made up of stars tidally removed from low-mass
satellites offer a direct, powerful and versatile means of probing the
Galaxy's gravity field \citep[see e.g.][]{Donald1982, Kuhn1993,
  Donald1995,Johnston1996,Helmi1999,Johnston1999,Murali1999}. Discussed
predominantly from a theoretical standpoint in the last decades of the
past century, stellar streams started to be discovered in large
numbers relatively recently
\citep[e.g.][]{Ibata2001,Odenkirchen2001,Newberg2002,
  Majewski2003,FOS,Grillmair2006,Koposov2014}.


The utility of a stellar tidal stream springs as soon as the kinematic
information is added as demonstrated convincingly by
\citet{Koposov2010}.

\section{Orphan Stream with \gaia DR2 RR Lyrae}

We select a high-purity all-sky sample of RR Lyrae candidate stars
from two separate source catalogues released as part of the \gaia DR2
\citep[][]{Prusti2016, Brown2018}. More precisely, tables
\texttt{vari\_classifier\_result} and \texttt{vari\_rrlyrae}
\citep[see][]{Clementini2018,Holl2018} are joined, removing the
duplicates, and the stellar astrometry and photometry are obtained
from the main \texttt{gaia\_source} catalogue. We have culled
potential interlopers requiring \textit{phot\_bp\_rp\_excess\_factor}
to be less than 3 and have assumed $A_G=2.27$ and $M_G=0.64$ for the
extinction coefficient and the RRL absolute magnitude in the \Gaia's
$G$ band respectively \citep[see][for further
  details]{Iorio2018}. Additionally, we have assumed the Sun's
distance from the Galactic center of 8 kpc, the Local Standard or Rest
(LSR) of 235 km s$^{-1}$ and the Sun's peculiar motion as given in
\citet{LSR}.

To select the likely OS members, we translate the stellar celestial
coordinates in equatorial system $\alpha, \delta$ into a new
coordinate system $\phi_1, \phi_2$ aligned with the stream \citep[see
  e.g.][]{Koposov2010}. More specifically, based on the OS detections
reported in \citet{OS_V, OS_C, Newberg2010}, we use a great circle
with a pole at $(\alpha_{\rm OS}, \delta_{\rm OS})=(70.5^{\circ},
-13^{\circ})$. The origin of this stream's coordinate system is chosen
to be at $(\alpha_0, \delta_0)=(188^{\circ}, -63^{\circ})$, near the
position of the OS's crossing of the Galactic disc. Several attempts
at the OS kinematic characterization can be found in
\citet{Newberg2010} and \citet{Sohn2016}. Given the OS's line-of-sight
velocity and the HST-based proper motions, we notice that the stream's
velocity component along the Galactic longitude $v_l$ remains negative
irrespective of the debris position on the sky, i.e. the stream is in
prograde motion with respect to the Galactic rotation. Accordingly, we
explore the distribution of the possible OS members selected with the
following simple cuts.

%
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    |\phi_2| &< 4^{\circ}\\
    -300<v_l &<-100\\
    -300<v_b &<300
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%

Figure~\ref{fig:xyzgdr2} shows the distributions of $\sim$1,500 RRL
stars selected with the above cuts in Galacto-centric coordinates
$X,Y$ and $Z$; here $X$ points to the Galactic anti-center and the Sun
is at $(X,Y,Z)=(8,0,0)$. A long and narrow arc or RRL stars is visible
in all three projections, crossing the Galaxy from the North (where it
is seen at $Z>0$ and $X>0$) to the South (where the signal is ar $Z<0$
and $X<0$). The stream spans a gigantic $\sim$100 kpc, traveling in
almost uninterrupted fashion through the Milky Way, coming as close as
$\sim$15 kpc to its center and reaching as far as $\sim$50 kpc into
the halo. While the Northern portion of the stream had been seen
before with SDSS and PS1, the view of its Southern Galactic section
uncovered here with \gaia DR2 is entirely new.

We can further clean the OS membership by looking closely at the
behavior of the RRL stars close to the equator of the stream's
coordinate system. To this end, Figure~\ref{fig:selection} shows the
distribution of RR Lyrae as a function of the along-stream coordinate
$\phi_2$. As the top panel of the Figure illustrates, the stream spans
some $\sim200^{\circ}$ in $\phi_1$ while exhibiting a slight bend of
several degrees in $\phi_2$. The heliocentric distance of the Orphan
debris changes slowly within $-50^{\circ}<\phi_1<50^{\circ}$, but
beyond that, the stream appears to shoot rapidly to large distances,
reaching $\sim50$ kpc on either end. Finally, a clear kinematic
pattern is visible in the bottom panel of Figure~\ref{fig:selection},
where the stream $\mu_{\phi,1}$ proper motion arches up to $\sim$4 mas
year$^{-1}$ around $\phi_1\sim40^{\circ}$ from values close to $\sim0$
mas year$^{-1}$ near the tips of the stream. Note that in all three
projections, the width of the stream also changes as a function of
$\phi_1$. Some of this variation may be due to the intrinsic evolution
of the debris density along the stream \citep[see e.g.][]{stray}, but
much of it may plausibly be associated with the change in the
measurement quality. As the stream moves away from the Sun at high
values of $|\phi_1|$, the associated errors in distance and proper
motion grow quickly, increasing the scatter around the stream's
centroid. 

Each panel of Figure~\ref{fig:selection} shows a sample of stars
selected after applying the polynomial masks from the other two panels
(the masked areas are highlighted in pale blue in each panel). The
boundaries of the masks are chosen to wrap around the bulk of the
stream's debris in a smooth and continuous manner. More precisely, the
masks are drawn as follow {\bf SK to explain}. The parameters of the
polynomials used for the stream selection are given in table XXX. {\bf
  SK to supply}. Applying all three masks shown in the Figure yields
the total of NNN OS candidate members. Table YYY lists all RRL stars
identified using the procedure described above together with their
positional and kinematic measurements from GDR2. {\bf Table
  needed}.

Figure~\ref{fig:xyzmem} is a companion to Figure~\ref{fig:xyzgdr2} as
it also shows the Galacto-centric positions of the \gaia RR Lyrae
stars, but now only those selected using the masks described
above. Left panel of the Figure emphasizes the high eccentricity of
the OS as the stream appears high stretched in this
projection. Noticeable in the middle and right panels of the Figure is
the change in the stream's curvature between the Southern and the
North Galactic hemispheres. The view of the OS in other phase-space
projections can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:memother}.

Top left panel of the Figure presents the on-sky positions of the
likely OS members in the stream-aligned coordinate system. Immediately
apparent is the striking change of the stream curvature around
$\phi_1\sim20^{\circ}$ - immediately after the stream re-emerges after
passing through the Galactic disc - where the debris behavior changes
from gently slopping down to sharply rising up in
$\phi_2$. Additionally, in the Northern end of the stream, at
$\phi_1\sim100^{\circ}$ there appears to be a curious hook
downwards. There exists a corresponding change in the debris
kinematics. For example, proper motion components $\mu_{\alpha}$ and
$\mu_{\delta}$ also show a switch in the gradient as a function of
$\phi_1$ around $\phi_1\sim20^{\circ}$. Note, however that the
evolution of the physical velocity components $v_l$ and $v_b$ (and
also $v_{\phi,1}$ and $v_{\phi,2}$) is considerably
smoother. Therefore, some of the change in the proper motions (shown
in the second row from the top) is due to the change in the
line-of-sight distance.
